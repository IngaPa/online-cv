      university: University of Zagreb
      time: 2010 - 2013
      details: |
        I focused my study and research goals towards bioinformatics.
          - Graduated with topic in population genetics: Genetic structure of the human population of Korčula island
          - Analyzed genotypes of thousand Croatian individuals
          - Used three types of genetic markers: mtDNA, Y chromosomal, and autosomal markers
          - Used an in-house R-scripts, STRUCTURE, ADMIXTURE, PLINK, and ADMIXTOOLS softwares.

    - degree: BSc in Molecular Biology
      university: University of Zagreb
      time: 2007 - 2010
      details: |
        During studies, I was an active bio-speleologist.
        
        - Collected samples and data in >100 speleological objects during multiple speleological expeditions in different EU countries
        - Reached the bottom of the deepest Croatian cave: Lukina Jama - Trojama (-1431m)
        - Conducted research: "Phylogenetic analysis of endemic bivalve Congeria kusceri Bole, 1962 (Dreissenidae, Bivalvia)." 
        - Mastered problem solving skills in the wet lab environment: PCR, DNA isolation and sequencing, cell and bacterial culture manipulation...
        - Awarded with: The Rector’s Award, The City of Zagreb Scholarship, University of Zagreb Scholarship for Top Students

       My core research idea is to develop a computational model to associate regulatory regions and their target genes using data integration approaches:
          - Developed two R packages: reg2gene and myDNA
          - Started myDNA blog and developed Shiny App
          - Integrated various datasets (H3K4me1,H3K27ac, DNAme, DHS, HiC) and 
            algorithms (elastic net, random forest, distance correlation and correlation)
